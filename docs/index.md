# Canyan Rating

Canyan Rating is an open source real-time highly scalable rating system. It is composed of an Agent Service, an API, and a Rating Engine.

The rating system is a critical component in any business, especially when real-time features are a strict requirement to ensure business continuity and congruence of transactions. Any compromise to availability, integrity, and authentication in the billing system makes a huge impact on the services provided.

Canyan aims to address these challenges with a cloud-native scalable solution, easily deployable and easily usable. It has been designed to work atomically ensuring the system status is always consistent, reproducible and coherent. Asynchronous processing of no real-time, consolidation events, prioritization, and time-boxed tasks provide the basics to ensure lightning-fast transaction processing without compromises.

Ease of use is addressed with comprehensive documentation, examples and high-quality software (see the test coverage badge).

Canyan Rating is designed as a microservice architecture and comprises [several repositories](https://github.com/canyanio). Its components are stateless and easily deployable via containers on-premises or in the cloud.
