The Agent repository is available [here](https://github.com/canyanio/rating-agent-hep).

This component uses the [HEP/EEP Encapsulation Protocol](https://github.com/sipcapture/hep)
for packet capture and mirroring of RTC solutions which allows for a transparent and unobtrusive rating solution. 
It is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language, documented and highly covered with tests (see badges above).
