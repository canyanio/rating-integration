Thank you for showing interest in contributing to the Canyan Rating project.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish 
to make via issue, slack, email, or any other method with the owners of this 
repository before making a change. 

if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, just ask or submit the
issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best
effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change
something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of
rules to get in the way of that.

Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) that applies to all contributors and participants to the Canyan project, please follow it in all your interactions 
with the project.


## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies and files are removed before your push. Please 
refer to the .gitignore and update the file if necessary to not push irrelevant files.
2. Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md with details of changes and needed 
documentation for added features.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the CHANGELOG.md to the 
new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other 
developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
