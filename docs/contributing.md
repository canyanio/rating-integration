When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish 
to make via issue, slack, email, or any other method with the owners of this 
repository before making a change. 

if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, just ask or submit the
issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best
effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change
something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of
rules to get in the way of that.

Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) that applies to 
all contributors and participants to the Canyan project, please follow it in 
all your interactions with the project.


## Pull Request

Pull requests are very welcome, and the maintainers of Canyan will work hard
to review and hopefully merge your work.

It can make sense to discuss your work beforehand if it is significant for
the project. You can start a discussion on [Slack](http://slack.canyan.io).

Using commit signoffs and changelog tags is mandatory for all commits!

### Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies and files are removed before your 
push. Please refer to the `.gitignore` and update the file if necessary to not 
push irrelevant files.
2. Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md with details of changes and needed 
documentation for added features.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the CHANGELOG.md 
to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other 
developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the 
second reviewer to merge it for you.


### Sign your work

Canyan is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. To ensure 
open source license compatibility, we need to keep track of the origin of 
all commits and make sure they comply with the license. To do this we ask every 
commit to be signed off.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch, which
certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an
open-source commit.  The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below
(from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):


```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
1 Letterman Drive

San Francisco, CA, 94129

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.
